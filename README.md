Knee injuries and impairments are common throughout the world, demanding effective rehabilitation treatments to improve patient recovery and lower healthcare expenses. This project focuses upon design of an innovative knee rehabilitation robotic system controlled by Artificial Intelligence (AI) . The suggested knee rehabilitation robot uses effective artificial intelligence algorithms to provide personalized and adaptable therapy to each patient. Knee problems are a common and debilitating condition that can affect people of all ages. Early detection and intervention is essential for preventing further damage to the knee joint. However, current methods for detecting and predicting knee problems are often invasive or expensive. In this research, a novel approach to the detection and prediction of knee problems is carried and used for curing knee problems. Our approach uses a combination of X-rays and machine learning algorithms to monitor the knee Oestoriartis severity. This allows us to identify early signs of knee problems, such as inflammation and changes in joint mechanics. A mechanism that can be attached to the knee to help in the rehabilitation process will be developed. This mechanism provides feedback on the user's movements and helps to correct any imbalances. This mechanism can help to speed up the rehabilitation process and reduce the risk of further injury. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that knee problems are detected and treated. Our approach is non-invasive, affordable, and easy to use. We believe that this approach could have a significant impact on the lives of people with knee problems.

the above were the sleeping design done after researching a long time this was desgined to release in the market as the previous desgin had some inor issues or stabality and control.

the AI model is designed to find the knee oestorisis so that the patients data can be changed accordingly as it hinders the knee movement.
